Hi! My name is Dmitrii M. Ostrovskii, or just __Dima__ (pronounced [d `i m a]) for friends. I am a researcher working in machine learning, statistics, optimization, and signal processing(http://www.dostrovsky.com/), currently a postdoc at INRIA Paris hosted by [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).
