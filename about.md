This is a blog on machine learning, statistics, optimization, and signal processing authored by [Dmitrii. M. Ostrovskii](http://www.dostrovsky.com/), currently a postdoc in the SIERRA Project-Team of INRIA Paris, hosted by [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/).

Earlier posts, related mostly to things I've leared during PhD, can be found in my [old blog](https://ostrodmit.blog/).
